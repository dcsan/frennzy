and send me (dc) their account login info.
i can then add them to our private repo so they can commit/checkout.

################# Install Ubuntu ################# 
if you're using a laptop that is running windows, it would be great if
you can install Ubuntu.


################# SET UP NODE (MAC) ################# 
d/l node .dmg with npm:
http://code.google.com/p/rudix/downloads/detail?name=node-0.3.4-0.i386.dmg&can=2&q=
https://sites.google.com/site/nodejsmacosx/

Run pkg installer for latest stable version

Open a terminal window:
confirm you have python
(type "which python" - should return something like /usr/local/bin/python)
confirm the node install ran
(type "node", and the terminal should echo "> ". If so, you're good. Hit CTRL-D to exit node)

Install express:
npm install express

install additional modules:
npm install mongodb
npm install mongoose
npm install ejs
npm install jade
npm install socket.io



################# setting up ssh keys  ################# 
to do anything server related, you need keys installed on the server.
to make a key:

ssh-keygen

# then just hit return for default paths

cd ~/.ssh

# then mail me the

id_rsa.pub

file. DONT open it in a text editor, or paste into email etc.
send as an email attachment.
its important that the file doesn't have any extra CR/LFs in it.

you could also just check your key into:

admin/keydir

but be careful to rename the file since everyones key will be called id_rsa.pub
i renamed mine my pubkey like user@host 
(tho it doesnt really matter what the file is called)
eg:

dc@metroid.local.pub

after the keys are setup, you need to "trust that host" the first time
so just login using ssh

# on DGs machine:
ssh root@173.255.251.200

The authenticity of host '173.255.251.200 (173.255.251.200)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 38:a8:2b:a8:a4:3f:3f:ea:ca:7a:e3:18:b3:29:6a:aa.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

if that doesnt work, debug it with ssh -v


################# deploying  ################# 
to do this you need to have your public key setup on the deploy
server. DC or someone will have to do this for you.

after editing a file, eg add something to know if stuff changed
eg server/views/index.ejs
just add some text to that page, and save
commit to your local git repository:
git -a -m "<insert a commit comment here>"
then sync with github using the github mac app or your preferred method

to deploy from github to the development server:

     cd server
     sc/monopoly-deploy.sh

and it should now be deployed
check from a browser (this is DG's temp server) :
http://prainz.com:8004/



################# install mongoDB ################# 
# http://shiftcommathree.com/articles/how-to-install-mongodb-on-os-x

curl -O http://downloads.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.4.0.tgz
tar xzf mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.4.0.tgz
sudo mv mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.4.0 /usr/local/mongodb
sudo mkdir /usr/local/mongodb_data /var/log/mongodb
sudo chown -R root /usr/local/mongodb


If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.0-x86_64/org.mongodb.mongod.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the org.mongodb.mongod.plist loaded:
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.0-x86_64/org.mongodb.mongod.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist

Or start it manually:
    mongod run --config /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.0-x86_64/mongod.conf
MongoDB 1.8+ includes a feature for Write Ahead Logging (Journaling), which has been enabled by default.
To disable journaling, use --nojournal.

## check it works
mongo
